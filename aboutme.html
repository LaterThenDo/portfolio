        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm <strong>Nirob Miazee</strong>. I am currently pursuing a diploma in 
                <strong>Game Development & Technology</strong> at <strong>Nanyang Polytechnic</strong>. 
                I have always been fascinated by games since I was nine, which was when I stumbled 
                across Roblox Studio out of boredom. That curiosity quickly grew into a 
                long-standing interest in creating games.
            </p>

            <p>
                My passion lies mainly in programming, especially action and stealth-based games. 
                Games such as <em>Hitman</em>, <em>Ready or Not</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, and <em>Assassin's Creed</em> 
                have all influenced the types of games I would like to develop. I am still exploring ideas, but my 
                focus always comes back to gameplay and mechanics over storytelling.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of game development, I stay active by practicing judo in school, while occasionally playing badminton. 
                When I have free time, I like experiment with side projects in Roblox Studio, though I tend to move on quickly 
                once the initial excitement of making the game fades. I'm always looking to sharpen my skills and push myself 
                with new programming challenges. You can read more on my hobbies

        <!-- Core Values -->
        <h2>Core Values</h2>
        <div id="core-values">
            <article class="core-value">
                <h3>Accountability</h3>
                <p>
                    I work best when there is a clear 
                    deadline in place, 
                    something or someone to answer to. 
                    In solo projects, it is easy for me 
                    to lose the initial excitement
                    without external pressure, 
                    but when I have responsibilities or 
                    expectations to meet, I stay focused 
                    and driven. I treat every task like 
                    it matters, and that mindset helps me 
                    push projects across the finish line.
                </p>
            </article>  

            <article class="core-value">
                <h3>Collaboration</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe that a good team works best 
                    when everyone feels confident in 
                    their role. I try my best to step into 
                    roles where I feel most capable, 
                    but I also try to make sure everyone 
                    else is in the right place too. 
                    Whether that means adjusting 
                    responsibilities or supporting 
                    others, I value collaboration as 
                    a way to motivate each other and 
                    create something better together.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="core-value">
                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>
                    At the core of every project I 
                    work on is the player's experience. 
                    I care most about how a game feels, 
                    how immersive or 
                    enjoyable it is. Coding and features 
                    matter, but they're only tools to 
                    serve that experience. I always ask 
                    myself how things could be better 
                    for the player, and that constant 
                    focus helps me improve with every 
                    version I build.
                </p>

        <section id="future-goals">
            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I know that I want to keep 
                exploring the technical side 
                of game development, especially in 
                areas like coding 
                and AI systems. I am particularly 
                drawn to FPS and stealth-based 
                action games, and one of my long-term 
                hopes is to contribute to a project 
                with the level of polish and impact 
                of something like Call of Duty.
            </p>

            <p>
                Right now, I am focused on building 
                my skills, working on personal 
                projects, and learning what makes 
                gameplay feel responsive, smart, 
                and immersive. Whether I eventually 
                join a game studio or work with a 
                small team of developers, 
                I am excited to keep growing through 
                collaboration and problem-solving.
                The goal 
                is not just to finish games, but to 
                keep getting better with each one.
            </p>
