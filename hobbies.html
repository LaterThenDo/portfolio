            <h3>Game Development</h3>
            <p>
                I've been interested in game development 
                since I was about 9 years old, when I 
                came across Roblox Studio while 
                playing around on Roblox which quickly 
                turned into a hobby 
                that I've carried with me for years. I 
                enjoy experimenting with game mechanics 
                and see how small changes affect how 
                a game feels to play. While I often start 
                side projects on Roblox Studio, I tend to 
                leave them unfinished because I get bored 
                easily, but for me, the fun is in the 
                process of building and learning, not 
                always the final product. Programming 
                is my favorite part of development, 
                especially when I can bring systems and 
                logic to life in a way that players can 
                interact with.

            <h3>Badminton</h3>
            <p>
                Badminton has been a big part of my 
                life since secondary school as it was my
                CCA. I have always enjoyed the fast-paced 
                nature of the sport and the mix of 
                strategy and reflexes it requires. These 
                days, I still play whenever I get the 
                chance, mostly for fun or as a way to stay 
                active. I find badminton as a great way to 
                unwind and spend time with 
                friends.

            <h3>Judo</h3>
            <p>
                I started practicing judo when I first 
                entered polytechnic and it quickly 
                became one of my favorite hobbies. 
                Through 
                regular training, I've gained strength, 
                confidence, and a deeper appreciation for 
                technique and timing. Every session pushes 
                me to improve, and I've come to enjoy the 
                sense of community within the club as well.

            <p>
                One of my most memorable experiences in Judo 
                was
                competing in the Inter-Tertiary Competition
                back in March 2025.
